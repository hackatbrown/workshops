### Welcome

We're so excited you're here. Let's start making a website. 

First thing's first, you'll need a text editor. What's the heck is a text editor you ask? Well, it's just what it sounds like: you use it to edit text, in the same way that you maybe use Word to write yours papers, we use text editors to write code!

We recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) <-- click there to download. 

Alright, now let's get started. 

Create a new folder on your desktop called "HTML/CSS"

Open up Sublime, go to the File dropdown and click "Save" (or press cmnd+s, just like any other old file). I know we haven't written anything to save yet. 

Save your file as `index.html` and put in your brand spankin new HTML/CSS folder.

What makes an HTML file different from any other file you've always wondered? Well, first and foremost the fact that it ends with `.html`. Congrats, you just made your first HTML file, you're well on your way!
