## Hi!

Welcome to the Clojure party. As you might have guessed, start is where we're starting the workshop and end is where we're ending. I've tried to do a good job documenting and explaining things in the code, but here are some more useful links. 

[Ring Documentation](http://ring-clojure.github.io/ring/index.html), which we will use a lot

[Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki), which sits on top of Ring

[Heroku Clojure docs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/clojure) (great tutorials!)
